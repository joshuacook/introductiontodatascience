We have previously about model selection and have considered managing the Bias-Variance Tradeoff as we fit our predictive model. We primarily focused on identifying the simplest possible model as a way to making sure that our model generalizes to new data. Now we expand on this by examining three new concepts in model assessment and selection.\n",
