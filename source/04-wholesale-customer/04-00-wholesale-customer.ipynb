    "**Domain** This is a canonical dataset taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is data collected from the sale of products by a grocery wholesaler in Portugal. The values are in \"monetary units\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem** While this task includes labels, it is typically used for clustering or unsupervised learning work. Here we will keep the labels for comparison but will be exploring this dataset in the context of EDA and unsupervised learning in an EDA setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two columns will work as label for this set `region` and `channel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution** We will be working toward a customer segmentation generated by a cluster analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data** The following analysis shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- there are 440 rows and 8 useful variable columns in the dataset. Two of these columns are target features `Region` and `Channel`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- there are six integer value columns:\n",
    "   - `Fresh`\n",
    "   - `Milk`\n",
    "   - `Grocery`\n",
    "   - `Frozen`\n",
    "   - `Detergents_Paper`\n",
    "   - `Delicatessen`\n",
    "\n",

    "**Benchmark** As this is an EDA and Unsupervised Learning task, we will not define an explicit benchmark. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics** We will not define a metric for this project at this time. "
