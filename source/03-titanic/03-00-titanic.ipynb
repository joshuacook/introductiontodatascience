    "**Domain** This is an introductory data set considered the \"hello world\" of data science. It is an ongoing competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) allowing students of data science to prepare a model and make a submission to a competition while they are still learning the subject. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem** This is a binary classification problem in which the challenge is to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic given the demographic data of the passengers. Here, the task $T$ is a binary classification and the experience $E$ is the list of passengers and their survival outcome. The machine learning challenge is to learn to perform this task using this experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution** To solve this problem, we will programmatically generate a vector of integers using filtering and masking. This could be thought of as a kind of proto-decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data** A preliminary analysis of the data shows the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- there are 891 rows and 10 useful variable columns in the dataset. One of these columns is the target `Survived`. An 11th and 12th column are a unique id for each passenger and the name of each passenger, respectively, and have no predictive power.\n",
    "- there are four integer value columns:\n",
    "   - `Survived`\n",
    "   - `Pclass`\n",
    "   - `SibSp`\n",
    "   - `Parch`\n",
    "- there are two numerical value columns:\n",
    "   - `Age`\n",
    "   - `Fare`\n",
    "- there are five factor columns:\n",
    "   - `Sex`\n",
    "   - `Ticket`\n",
    "   - `Cabin`\n",
    "   - `Embarked`\n",

    "**Benchmark** We will use a naive guess based on the most common class as a benchmark. 61.6% of passengers did not survive. We will guess for our benchmark that there were no survivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics** As this is an beginning exercise, we will use the accuracy."
